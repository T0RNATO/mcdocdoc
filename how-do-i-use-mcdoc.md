# How do I use mcdoc?
Mcdoc powers [Spyglass](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass), and all of its autocompletion,
and you can give it extra hints about how to autocomplete your things too - like nbt storages.

To start, create a folder called `mcdoc` inside your pack root, and then a folder inside that for a namespace.
Finally, you can create a file with a `.mcdoc` extension. The path should look like `<pack root>/mcdoc/<namespace>/my_file.mcdoc`.

Note that you don't actually have to use this path, but it's the convention.
