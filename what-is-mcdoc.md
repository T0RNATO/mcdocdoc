# What is mcdoc?
Mcdoc is a schema format for describing Minecraft's data structures, like its codecs, JSON files, and NBT compounds.
For example, the entirety of vanilla Minecraft is documented [here](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vanilla-mcdoc),
and this can be a great place to look if you're ever confused about some syntax beyond this documentation.
